# Loita hack
A Rainmeter skin that displays track information from various media players. This is a mod of Loita by Lgv91, itself a mod of Soita by poiru, that adds repeat and shuffle buttons to the interface.

Disclaimer: I don't plan to update the skin with more features because the only new feature I need atm is the repeat and shuffle buttons; I'm also not sure what else can the NowPlying plugin do, plus I'm not much of a programmer and made this mod for personal use.

Version history:

1.1.1 / May 20, 2023

* Initial commit and release.
* Changes from the original skin:
  * Added "Repeat" and "Shuffle" buttons.

Known issues: 
* Loita had an shortcut to open the configuration menu on middle-clicking the main skin, but it refuses to work in my mod for some reason even though I haven't changed any code related to this. Looking into this issue.
* I've only tested the skin with iTunes; it might not work as well with other players; I saw people complaining about issues with other players on Loita's page; I assume that those issues are because of the NowPlaying plugin and not of the skin code so I can't do anything about it anyway.
* The icons could be better but I don't have much experience with pixelart; tried my best to make them blend in with the rest of the buttons.
* "Repeat" function only switches between off and repeat track, can't do anything about that since it's a NowPlaying limitation.
